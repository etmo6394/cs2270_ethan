All office hours are held in ECCS 128, also known as the CSEL. 
This room requires a keycard for entry, but you can get one by
following the instructions at [http://csel.cs.colorado.edu/](http://csel.cs.colorado.edu/).

The schedule will begin Jan 28. (Gabe is doing office hours already.)
You might find people in the lab to help, so be bold and give it a
shot.

For specific office hours please see the

Course Purpose 
=======

The purpose of this class is to introduce you to some of the
fundamental tools in computer science: data structures and the
algorithms that operate on them. This will be a tricky course, but it
is _not_ by any means meant to be a "weed out" class. If you are
having trouble, please come see me before it is too late and we can
work something out.

Computer programming, and the more general idea of computational
thinking, is rapidly becoming a basic literacy skill. By the end of
this course you should be prepared to tackle many advanced CS and
programming challenges.

Grading and Course Structure
=======

There are two components to your final grade: Homeworks and
tests. Each component is worth 1/2 of your grade. Homeworks are due on
Fridays. Test dates and homework due dates are given on the calendar.

Homeworks (165 points possible)
--------

There are _eleven_ homework assignments. Each is worth 15 points, for
a total of 165 points. Homeworks are due at 6pm. After they are late,
you may only receive a maximum of 5 points. You may use RetroGrade to
turn in your assignment as often as you like. Keep in mind that if you
turn it in after it is due, it will cap your score at 5/15.

Many assignments can be completed in more than one language, though
you are only required to complete it in C++. Happily, you can turn in
assignments in the other available langauges and earn up to 15 extra
credit points.

At the end of the semester, _provided you received at least 5 points
on all homework assignments_, extra credit will be aded to your total
homework grade, but **extra credit is weighted at 50%**. So for
example, suppose your homework score is 150, you qualify for extra
credit, and you have 40 points of extra credit. Your final homework
score would then be:

    final_hw_score = hw_score + (0.5 * extra_credit)
	==
    final_hw_score = 150 + (0.5 * 40) = 170
	
So in this example you got 103% on the homework component. Congrats.

**Collaboration on homework assignments is strongly encouraged.** If
you work together or find a web site with code that you learn from,
_you must indicate the relevant people and web sites in the source
code you submit_. Further, if you do work with other people, or find
code on other web sites, _you must type all the code yourself._
Obviously we can't police copy/paste, so please realize this is for
your own good. You won't learn anything with Control-V.

Homework assignment descriptions and file downloads will appear in the
course GitHub repository over time. I will try to make them available
far in advance so you can work ahead if you like.

Tests (165 points possible)
-----

There are three tests. Two will happen during normal lecture periods,
and the final is held whenever the university scheduled it. (I'll find
out when this is.) The first two tests will cover material covered
just before it; the final will be comprehensive.

_Tests are not collaborative. The Eye of Sauron will be watching. So
will I. Do not cheat._

Tests have the following point values:

* Test 1: 40 points
* Test 2: 50 points
* Final: 75 points

Specific information about tests will appear in the course GitHub
repository about a week before they happen.

Reading Material
==========

There is no required book for this course. There are a number of
high-quality introductory texts available online. Learning to program
is best done by writing lots and lots of code, and the fundamental
ideas in computer science are well-documented far and wide. If one
source is confusing to you, try a different one. But above all, write
code. Sometimes, a description of some concept is confusing until you
try implementing it in code.

We will primarily use the C++ version of book linked below by Clifford
A. Shaffer. There are two versions of this book that differ only
slightly---one is for C++, the other for Java. You are required to
turn in assignments in C++, but extra credit may be earned by
submitting in Java or Python. 

The books below are freely available on the web, but in some cases you
can give the author money if you want a nicer version.

Your Rights

Disability Accommodations
-------

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please
submit to me a letter from Disability Services in a timely manner so
that your needs may be addressed. Disability Services determines
accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact:
303-492-8671, Willard 322, and
http://www.Colorado.EDU/disabilityservices.

Disability Services' letters for students with disabilities indicate
legally mandated reasonable accommodations. The syllabus statements
and answers to Frequently Asked Questions can be found at
http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices.

Religious Observances
-------

Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty
make every effort to reasonably and fairly deal with all students who,
because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams,
assignments or required attendance. In this class, {{insert your
procedures here}} See full details at
http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html

Classroom Behavior
-------

Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an
appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such
behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional
courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to
individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture,
religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender variance, and
nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the
student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you
by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this
preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate
changes to my records. See polices at
http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html and at
http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs/code.html#student_code.

Honor Code
------

All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible
for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this
institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating,
plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery,
and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall
be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu;
303-725-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the
academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions
from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not
limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Other
information on the Honor Code can be found at
http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html and at
http://www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode/.

Discrimination and Sexual Harrassment
--------

The University of Colorado at Boulder policy on Discrimination and
Harassment http://www.colorado.edu/policies/discrimination.html, the
University of Colorado policy on Sexual Harassment and the University
of Colorado policy on Amorous Relationships applies to all students,
staff and faculty. Any student, staff or faculty member who believes
s/he has been the subject of discrimination or harassment based upon
race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, religion, sexual
orientation, or veteran status should contact the Office of
Discrimination and Harassment (ODH) at 303-492-2127 or the Office of
Judicial Affairs at 303-492-5550. Information about the ODH and the
campus resources available to assist individuals regarding
discrimination or harassment can be obtained at
