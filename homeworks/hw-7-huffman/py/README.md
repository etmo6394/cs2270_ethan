Huffman Encoding (Python)
=========

This is similar to the C++ version. There is weirdness with the
priority queue, however. Python does have a priority queue, but it is
implemented with a series of visitor functions that use a standard
list.

See `pq_example.py` for details on how to use the `heapq` module
functions to get the priority queue working.
