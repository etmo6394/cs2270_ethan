Binary Search Trees
===========

For this assignment (and for the rest of the semester), please consult
the

Language-specific instructions are found in the respective
directories.

There are __loads__ of resources on the web for learning how binary
trees work, and what you might use them for. You might be interested
in
[this tree processing page at CMU](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/15-200/lectures/treeprocessing/index.html)
that gives a fair amount of code examples. It is in psuedocode, but
you should be able to translate it to C++. (Right?)

I put up my notes on recursion and the binary search tree operations
in the BinarySearchTrees.pdf file in this directory. That might be
helpful for review, too.
