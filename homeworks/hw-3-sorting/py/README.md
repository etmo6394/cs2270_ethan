Sorting (Python)
=============

Edit sorting.py and replace all the 'pass' statements with your
implementation. Don't change any of the function names. You could
change the parameter names if you want, but don't touch the function
names.

__Keep in mind__ that most of these functions don't return anything:
they modify the input list. So I could write:

	my_data = [ 8, 2, 9, 10, 4, 8, 2 ]
	bubblesort(my_data)
	print my_data
	
This will print out:

	[ 2, 2, 4, 8, 8, 9, 10 ]

Have fun Pythoning.
