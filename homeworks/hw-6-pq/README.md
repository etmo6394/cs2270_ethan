Priority Queues
==========

Priority Queues are similar to normal first-in-first-out (FIFO) queues, except 
items in a priority queue are arranged according to a priority. After adding an
item to a priority queue, its position is determined by its priority relative to
the other items in the queue.

Items are removed from the queue in order of their priority.

We can also `peek` inside a queue, which gives us the highest priority item, but
does not remove it from the queue.

The trick with this assignment is that you have to design the data structure and
related algorithms. You can implement this in a number of ways: using a heap, a tree,
a linked list, arrays, vectors, you name it.
