BTrees (Java)
=========

The invariants and all of that are consistent with the C++
version. See the directory above for details.

The Java version has a class called BTree that contains BTree.Node
objects. You should extend BTree in the file BTreeImpl.java and
implement the three required functions (insert/remove/contains) in
addition to whichever helper functions you need to create to make
everything work.

Most of the helpful documentation is in the BTree.java file, but you
will be responsible for editing the BTreeImpl file.
